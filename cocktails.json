For a more intense experience, replace the Tabasco with horseradish.","","Did you know","To commemorate the inauguration of an Italian restaurant in 1969, Calgary bartender Walter Chell created Bloody Caesar. Chell took his inspiration from the Bloody Mary, but since clam sauce was on the menu, he spent a few weeks crushing some of these molluscs, until he managed to achieve the perfect balance with the tomato juice. More Bloody Caesars are sold in Canada than any other cocktail."]},

If you want to recreate the original taste, spice the tomato juice yourself using the original ingredients (and keep away from ready-made spiced tomato juice blends). You can make a Virgin Mary (the alcohol-free version of the Bloody Mary), by using 40 ml (1 1/3 oz.) more tomato juice instead of the vodka.","","Did you know","Three different stories attempt to explain the name “Bloody Mary.” Some claim it is a reference to Mary Tudor Queen of England, whose reputation as a bloody queen earned her this cocktail namesake. Others maintain that a bartender named it after a girl named Mary who frequented the Bucket of Bloody Club in Chicago. The third theory is that Ernest Hemingway came up with this name, in honour of his wife, Mary Welsh, who bemoaned his heavy drinking."]},
